				<p>Uzumaki is a Japanese horror manga series written and illustrated by Junji Ito. It was published in Big Comic Spirits from 1998 to 1999. It was officially translated into English by Viz Media, and it is available on their website to read. The author is known for writing horror mangas and some of his notable works are Tomie and Gyo. The manga depicts bodily horror, which includes grotesque deformation of people into spirals, humans changing into animals, and destruction of the human body. It also portrays vampirism and cannibalism, although not in the traditional sense. The manga has been adapted into a live-action film and an anime is in the works and is slated to release in October 2022.</p>
				<p>Uzumaki is set in a fictional city of Kurouzu-cho, a normal city at first glance which is slowly consumed by seemingly disconnected horrible events, except they all involve spirals, hence the name of the manga. The city is bordered by sea and mountains on two sides.</p>
				<p>The story is told from the point of view of high-school teenager Kirie Goshima who finds herself constantly tangled in different horrors involving people in her surroundings, with one thing in common: they all involve spirals. This starts with the obsession of her boyfriend’s father with spirals. There are only 19 chapters in the manga, but each chapter is densely packed with story. Different aspects of the spiral curse are explored in each chapter and its effects become progressively worse with chapters. The reasons for these supernatural events are beyond the comprehension of humans in the manga and hence that of the reader. This gives the author leeway to explain the disconnected events just as the effects of curse, but still there are some occurrences which don’t make sense even with this assumption. This might leave a bad taste in your mouth if you are the kind of person who doesn’t like loose plot threads, but with that mystery, it also leaves you with a sense of curiosity to wonder about it. For me it invoked mixed feelings, first feeling let down and later, an acceptance that humans weren’t simply far enough to comprehend it, and other endings might have been a bit out of place.</p>
				<p>The characters are nothing out of ordinary. They are people as you would expect from real life; not even the POV character has any special abilities. Only one of the characters is able to sense danger and has ominous feelings about the city — Kirie’s boyfriend —  but it is strictly limited to bad vibes. In this story, none of the characters are consequential, they are just vessels to explore the different effects of the curse. This shows in the plot clearly as no other aspects of characters are explored apart from their involvement in the incident of spiral curse. As such, there is negligible connection with the characters. The bad side of this is it makes the events less impactful as you aren’t able to sympathise with the characters, but at the same time it spares you from being sad while you are horrified.</p>
				<p>The art is detailed and the panelling is superb. You can breeze through the manga without any hiccups. One could say that the author has a knack for drawing horror. The art is enough to send a chill down your spine and it boosts the impact of unfolding events even further. You should know by the genre of the manga itself, but if you are repulsed by grotesque art, you might want to stay away from this manga as it leverages that to its full extent. Do note, however, that doing this will deprive you the experience of admittedly one of the best manga in this genre.</p>
				<p>There is no other way to put it - if you are not averse to the horror genre and haven’t read Uzumaki till now, dive in. It can be read completely in one sitting, and you will have a great time.</p>

				<h3>Synopsis</h3>
			<img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/1.webp" style="width:200px; display: block; float: right; margin: 0px 10px;">
				<p>Yeon-woo's twin brother disappeared five years ago, only for his pocket watch to suddenly fall into Yeon-woo's hands. Inside, Yeon-woo found a hidden diary. "By the time you hear this, I guess I will already be dead..."</p>
				<p>Obelisk, the Tower of the Sun God, is a world where several universes and dimensions intersect. Yeon-woo's brother died after being betrayed while he climbed the tower, and after learning the truth, Yeon-woo decided to climb the tower with the help of his brother's diary.</p>
				<p class="quote">"From now on, I am Cha Jeong-woo.”</p>
				<h3>Art - 10/10</h3>
				<p>The art is quite similar to Solo Leveling and other manhwas like “The Second Coming of Gluttony” and “The Beginning After The End”. The character designs have a charming appeal to them (super hot male characters uwu). I would consider it to have some of the best art in this genre.</p>
				<h3>Story- 9/10</h3>
				<p>The most important element of any main character is their drive. Here is his desire to take revenge for his twin brother. The story starts with the main character acing every single trial that is thrown at him. The way he tackles each trial uniquely is interesting and an out-of-the-box approach. The build-up is quite good, and even though the number of characters is numerous, the author handles them quite well. The development of the main character is quite well-progressed. The only drawback to the story is that remembering so many abilities can be difficult at times [perhaps the author addressed this later in the manhwa;)].</p>
				<h3>Characters- 6/10</h3>
				<p>Well, I would consider this the weakest part of the series. The side characters are just not that well-developed. Do I care about them? No. Will it be any different if one of them dies? No. That's the issue here. The whole series is overly dependent on the main character, although Yeon-woo does cover up for the lacunae of his comrades. The characters that I personally liked would be Edora, Martial King and Phante in the beginning of the manhwa.</p>
				<h3>Epilogue</h3>
				<p>Personally, this is one of my favourite manhwas and will remain at the top of my list for quite some time. Even though I have read numerous overpowered MC manhwas, Second Life Ranker touched my weebheart the most. I would recommend you this manhwa as a must-read.</p>

				<p class="quote">"Until I understand what true strength is. I'm the Challenger! So I will always stand up."</p>
				<p>After you have ripped and burned everything you have, what makes you stand? What makes you see the end? For a person like Ippo, it is his will to endure, his will to fight, and his will to win no matter what. This journey of Ippo is what will be presented to you in the animated series called "Hajime no Ippo."</p>
				<img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/2.webp" style="width:350px; float:left; display:block; margin: 0px 10px;">
				<p>Hajime no Ippo is a Japanese boxing-themed manga series written and illustrated by George Morikawa. It has been serialized by Kodansha in Weekly Shnen Magazine since October 1989 and collected into 133 tankbon volumes as of March 2022. The anime has had 3 seasons, 1 TV film, and 1 OVA. Many fans are awaiting the return of the anime with a new season.</p>
				<p>The anime takes place in Japan and revolves around the main character, Makunouchi Ippo. Ippo is a character that many would call "too kind for his own good." In the beginning of the anime, we see that Ippo works really hard between his school and job to support his mother. It is clearly implied that his father has already passed away, and therefore he has quite the burden to handle. He also has another problem: being bullied by three of his classmates. Those 3 attack him mentally and physically simply for the sake of it.And it is implied that Ippo has been a victim of their bullying for a long time because he didn't and couldn't fight back against them. Though this bullying was ultimately what led to his journey as a pro-boxer starting,</p>
				<p>The first season of the anime was released in 2000, which explains why it has the raw and rough texture that is characteristic of many of the older anime. The fight animation in the anime makes you crave for more, and the sound track and sound effects used during the fights take it up a notch. (Especially the use of shotgun firing sounds and jet plane sounds for punches.) The use of soundtracks in the anime is one of the best that I have ever seen.</p>
				<img src="/assets/releases/2022-12-1/3.webp" style="width:350px; float:right; display:block; margin: 0px 10px;">
				<p>The story of anime is one that uses the age-old Shonen story structure as its base, though that doesn't make its story less interesting. That's because it isn't a singular rise of the protagonist with ever-increasing power and feats; the protagonist has to suffer, he has to face defeats, and he gets into situations that he finds difficult to overcome. Also, the anime isn't solely focused on the main character; we get various episodes on the backstory and feats of many side characters. Also, anime tends to keep the characters consistent over time. The various training sessions shown in the anime are powerful enough to make any of us viewers want to train in real life.</p>
				<p>The continuous character development of the protagonist is something I loved while matching the anime. He slowly develops his self-confidence, and he begins to pursue his goal towards the top of boxing.</p>
				<p>For anyone looking for an intense and energetic sports anime, I would definitely recommend this. Even outside the sports genre, this anime is a gem.</p>

				<p>Erased is a 12-episode anime which features 29-year old manga artist Satoru Fujinuma as the protagonist with a mysterious time travel power. This power/phenomenon is invoked whenever there is some sort of death that he can prevent. To do so, Satoru is sent a few minutes back where he figures out what he needs to do and prevents the unfortunate incident. However, when someone close to him gets murdered and he is falsely accused to be the murderer, the phenomenon is invoked and he is sent back 18 years in time. He figures that the murder must be related to the abduction and murder of one of his classmates during that time. Watch as he tries to uncover the truth behind these heinous crimes.</p>
				<p>Erased is a suspense-thriller whose plot is intriguing and which will keep you at the edge of your seat at all times. This anime was released in 2016 and quickly rose up in popularity and is even called one of the best anime of the decade. There is not much character development as much as there is character building, since the main characters are elementary schoolers. While the anime focuses on mainly the thriller part, a lot of warm and heart touching moments also show up. There are people who have heavily criticized it for a certain part(which I won't be telling here), but this anime is definitely worth a try. Since, the entire story completes in 12 episodes, saying anything more just might spoil the enjoyment, so I recommend you watch it yourself.</p>

			<h2>Top 10 Popular Action Manhwas</h2>
			<br/>
			<div class="article-author">By: Vidunram A R</div>

			<div class="article-content">
				In a time when there are so many new Manhwas releasing every month, with some of them even getting adaptations like anime, games or even live-action dramas, here are some of the most popular action Manhwas as of now.
				<div class="article-end"></div>
			{# Number 10: done#}
				<h3 style="text-align:center">10. Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</h3>
				<p>"I am Dokja. A reader." As Kim Dokja finishes reading his favourite web novel "Three Ways to Survive an Apocalypse (TWSA)", he finds an author note, which allows him to download the whole novel before it becomes paid content. Once it is downloaded, the lights in the train he was travelling start to flicker, and scenes which he was all too familiar with were happening. The novel, TWAS, was becoming a reality, and Kim Dokja is the only one who has read it to the end. Will Kim Dokja be able to survive the apocalypse? Or will he conquer the stage while surpassing even the protagonist of the novel, a regressor with years of experience? Read this absolute hit to find out.</p>
				<p>This adaptation of the popular web novel of the same name has all three things which make something worth reading: an awesome plot, stunning visuals and some awesome characters. If you pick this up and are awestruck by the story already, you will be dumbfounded to find out what's in store.</p>

			{# Number 9: done #}
				<h3 style="text-align:center">9. Overgeared</h3>
				<p>Shin Youngwoo is an unlucky loser in both real life and the most popular virtual reality game 'Satisfy' in which he plays Grid. When Grid finds the legendary class change item 'Pagma's Rare Book' in an S-class quest, he unfortunately dies, making him a level -1 player as a consequence of changing classes and dying in the middle of an S-Class quest. This manhwa focuses on Grid, as he makes his way from being the first negative-levelled player to the most powerful, or rather, 'Overgeared' character in the world of Satisfy.</p>
				<p>The consistent pacing and development of the story over various arcs is what has held the Manhwa's popularity and allowed its creator to publish a 1750+ chapter web novel.</p>

			{# Number 8: done #}
				<h3 style="text-align:center">8. The God of High School</h3>
				<p>"The best fighter, I'm the best fighter." 17-year-old Mori Jin, a prodigy who learned Taekwondo from his grandfather, had no losses in any fights he participated in, that is until he was invited to the 'God of High School' competition. His first loss is when he fights the commissioner who invites him to the competition. After experiencing his first defeat, Mori Jin chooses to participate in the competition to fight strong people from all over the world. This absolute mixture of action, comedy and folklore has finally ended, making this probably the perfect time to pick it up (or pick it back up in case you left it during one of its many breaks)</p>
				<p>While this series started as a way of merging different lores and myths through a fight show, the story has evolved into something far greater than what it is, leading to a grand universe of action which you just can't get tired of.</p>

				<h3 style="text-align:center">7. Return of the Blossoming Blade (alt: Return of the Mount Hua Sect)</h3>
				<p>Chung Myung, the Plum Blossom Sword Saint, finds himself dying on the battlefield after killing the demon Chun Ma. However, he is reincarnated in a beggar child's body 100 years after he died against Chun Ma. What surprises the master of the blade is that the Mount Hua Sect, whose swordsmanship was recognized by Chun Ma as the strongest, is not even one of the top Twelve Sects. This story revolves around the reincarnated Chung Myung's efforts in restoring the Mount Hua Sect to its former glory.</p>
				<p>This manhwa is known for the protagonist's seemingly two-faced behaviour and comedic expressions throughout the story, be it 'charming' his brothers into becoming stronger, or ripping off a merchant using his skills (mild spoilers; harmless without context)</p>

				<p>After being separated from his family 10 years ago in a plane crash, Yu Ijin is finally reunited with his family in Korea. When he is enrolled in high school, he experiences a lot of new things, like friendships, PC cafes, gaming and even bullying. What most people don't know is that Ijin was one of the world's deadliest mercenaries. This Manhwa revolves around Ijin as he adjusts to his new life while encountering various friends and foes, new and old alike.</p>
				<p>This manhwa is an absolute favourite among many for its action sequences and how it turns simple day-to-day events into comedic events without changing the pacing of the story as a whole.</p>

Nano Machine, a system of millions of nanobots present throughout his body, is programmed to assist Cheon Yeo-Woon. Read this Manhwa to see Yeo-Woon enter the Demonic Academy and become the strongest warrior in the Demonic Cult while taking revenge on those who have wronged him.</p>
				<p>The sci-fi element that Nano Machine offers, combined with a Martial Arts setting, put together by its wonderful story and characters make it something which many people are hooked onto.</p>

As he blends in using the most common type of clothing - a school uniform, he finds an old friend as the school's headmaster. Read this story about a 'noble', a being with supernatural abilities, as he learns more about life in the human world while also taking on the evils of the world.</p>
				<p>This Manhwa gained popularity with its character designs and developments, while also including comedy in the most simple and seemingly obvious things.</p>

			{# Number 3: done #}
				<h3 style="text-align:center">3. Eleceed</h3>
				<p>From the author of Noblesse, this manhwa focuses on the adventures of a cat-loving boy, Seo Jisoo who is fast (and I mean really fast) and, you guessed it (no you didn’t), a talking cat. Kayden, a man with the ability to transform and use electricity, turns into a stray cat when he is injured. As fate would have it, Kayden’s the talking cat. Read this story to find out why Kayden was injured, how Jisoo adjusts to his powers and what the biggest mess this dynamic duo can get themselves into.</p>
				<p>Why is it popular? It’s pretty simple. It has a new story concept, some top-tier comedy and most importantly, cats!!!</p>

Searching for her, Bam finds himself entering the Tower as an Irregular, someone who has entered the tower but was not chosen by it. Watch Bam climb the tower in his quest to find Rachel, while making a lot of allies, going through tough ordeals, and large forces which act behind the scenes.</p>
				<p>The fascinating thing about this Manhwa is how any reader will find something new every time they re-read the series. The author SIU has done a marvellous job with the plot and the characters.</p>

			{# Number 1: done #}
				<h3 style="text-align:center">1. Solo Leveling</h3>
				<p>Sung Jin-Woo, an F-class hunter with nothing specifically remarkable about his abilities, finds himself trapped in a double dungeon. Moments before his death, he gets a notification. "You have obtained the right to become a player. Do you accept it?" Once he accepts it, he finds himself in the hospital after being unconscious for three days. With all his injuries healed, and a status window with quests, penalties and much more, Jin-Woo starts pushing himself to become the best hunter of all time.</p>
				<p>This is definitely the most popular Manhwa. While this Manhwa gained fame because of its art and story, it also became a trendsetter in many ways, the most common one being how most new Manhwas have a 'player system' for the protagonist. While this theme has been prevalent for a while, its use has increased by a drastic margin after Solo Leveling.</p>
