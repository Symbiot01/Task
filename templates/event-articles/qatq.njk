		After the end of meticulous mid-semester exams for the seniors and the first semester of their college lives for the freshmen, our society decided to start things off in the spring semester with a quiz event in March bringing fans from four different fandoms together- namely the power-packed One Punch Man, the heroic My Hero Academia, the epic Naruto, and the thrilling Attack on Titan.
	</p>
	<p>
		Participants eagerly engaged their minds, furiously tapping on their devices in pursuit of the ultimate reward: coveted merch t-shirts adorned with the 
		emblems of their favorite anime, accompanied by a treasure trove of enticing goodies. In a comical twist of fate, the first prize winners 
		turned out to be students from different academic years.
