	<h1>Manga & Anime Society, Kharagpur</h1>

			こんにちは！ We are the <b>Manga & Anime Society, Kharagpur (MASK)</b>. We are a group of manga and anime enthusiasts who work on things related to it.
		</p><br/>
		<h2 style="margin: 8px 0px; text-align: left;">Backstory Time </h2>
		<p style="margin: 8px 0px;">
			Like fatherless shonen protagonists, MASK didn't have a proper parental figure. ;-; The society was established in 2020 by a couple of students from IIT Kharagpur who dreamed of having a place to discuss and promote anime and manga. The idea spread and became popular, and before we knew it, we had our fourth batch of members.<br/>
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h2 style="margin: 8px 0px; text-align: left;">What We Do Over Here</h2>
		<p style="margin: 8px 0px 8px 0px;">
			We, as a society, work on quite a few things, ranging from fan-arts and AMVs to reviews, newsletters and puzzles. We are also slowly expanding our reach to some other domains as well, but those will be kept in suspense for now ;)<br/><br/>
			We accept fan-arts and AMVs from others outside our society and are open to publishing and featuring them. In case you want to publish your art under our handle, do submit them through our <a href="/submissions" style="color:rgba(200,200,255,0.47);" target="blank">external submissions form</a> (which you can also find on the main page).
