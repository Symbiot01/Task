	<h2>Manga & Anime Society, Kharagpur</h2>
	<div class="text">
		Established in 2020, MASK is a society founded by a couple students from IIT kharagpur who dreamed of having a place for people to enjoy discussing and promoting anime/manga. The idea was widely popular, and eventually expanded to cover Korean and Chinese equivalents like manhwa.
		<br/><br/>
		Currently, MASK is in its second year of activity, and has garnered significant attention for its planned activities. None of this would've been possible without the incredible efforts of the batches that we've had so far, right from the founding batch to the newest batch of second-years.
		<br/><br/>
		What the society will do in the future is as of yet unknown, but people expect great things.
